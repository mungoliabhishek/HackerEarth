1. Number of students n <= 10^5
2. Though their preference of min and max sweet may be large <=10^9, there are 10^5 students in total
3. So, sort all numbers and compress the range.
4. In this reduced dimension, Add +1 to min and -1 to max+1
5. Now, simply iterate through these n ranges and find where max occurs, that is number of studnets who will be happy and for chocolates required expand the index.

Happy Coding
