Digit number

For 1 length number possible elements = 3
For 2 length = 3*3 =9
For 3 length = 3*3*3 =27
and so on,

simply take the prefix sum and return the right index depending on the query.



Compare String
Use set, and keep in it all the index where the two strings differ.

Now for every query, just do the check that now, which is the first index where they differ and which is larger, that't it.
