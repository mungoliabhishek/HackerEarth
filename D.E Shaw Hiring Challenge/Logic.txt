TravellingAnt Logic

Couldn't get it passed in within time Limits.

My logic ~ Simple DP to find number of ways, it reached starting point at end.
Complexity O(T*n)
Space Complexity O(T*n)


AndSum Awesome Question

Suppose n elements have bit 'x' set.
Now these n elements can come together in x = (nC1 + nc2 +..ncn) possible combinations
So, bit 'b' will be set in all these subsets, resulting in x * (1<<b) adding to the result.
