Fill boxes logic

3 cases, after sorting of box and balls

1 2 3
1 2 3

or

1 2 10 20 30
10 20 30

or

10 20 30
1 2 3 10 20 30

In first case, both pointers move simultaneously
In second case, first pointer move till 10 and second pointer has not made any movement yet and then both move
In third case second pointer moves till 10 and then both makes progress


So, I simply binary search for box satisfying first ball, suppose index i
Then binary search for ball 2, but index of box from i+1 to n
and so on....

Routes logic
Dijkstras, with taking caring to flight time, halting time
Also optimal path needs to be of shortest time alsong with cheapest cost.
